\## Password Generator



This program generates random passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.  

It was built to practice for loops, `random.choice()`, and working with user input.



This version is the Harder version according to Angela Yu, where you need to append the randomly generated characters into a list and then shuffle and print.
