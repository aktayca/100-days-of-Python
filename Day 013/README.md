# Day 13

## Debugging
Well, today's course was about debugging. Debugging tips, using a debugger on an IDE, etc. The course did have some coding exercises but they were basically just debugging of the old exercises, so I found it pointless to add.

It's also a sunday today, so let's call this an off day.
