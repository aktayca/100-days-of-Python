##Day 1
Day 1 is naturally the simplest of the days. I have only one project for this day.

##Team Name Generator
Angela Yu originally makes a Band Name generaetor, but I very slightly altered it and decided that the formula works better as an American style Team Generator.
It asks the user for the city they live in and their pet's name, then combines them to suggest a team name.
