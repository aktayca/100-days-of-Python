# Day 006

Today I learned that by writing my README.md files in notepad, I screwed up the title stylings in my Day 5 readme. If you are reading this, I already fixed it.

## Escape The Maze
Day 6 was about While loops and functions. Majority of the course content was mostly on https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html solving puzzles so unfortunately no external project today.
My code was good enough to solve everything up until the custom scenarios Ms. Yu provided. There I ran into the problem of my code getting stuck in a "turn right if you can" loop or a "go straight instead of turning right" loop. Ms. Yu says that solving that loop might require some more know-how, so I will return on Day 15 to tackle it again. Expect my solution for this on Day 15.
