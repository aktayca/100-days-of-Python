## Number Guessing Game  

This program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.  
The player selects a difficulty level (*easy* or *hard*), which determines the number of attempts.  

The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player if itâ€™s **too high** or **too low**, until they either guess correctly or run out of attempts.
