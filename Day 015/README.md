## Coffee Machine  
This program simulates a coffee machine. Users can choose drinks, pay with coins, and the machine checks resources before serving.  

### Features  
- Tracks available resources (water, milk, coffee, money)  
- Handles coin input and calculates change  
- Checks if resources are sufficient before making a drink  
- Supports shutting down the machine with `off` and printing a `report` of resources

## Day 006 Exercise: Reeborg's Maze
As promised, managed to solve the infinite loop issue that I mentioned on Day 6 readme file. The solution turned out to be different from Ms. Yu's 
but still solved all three scenarios without a problem.
